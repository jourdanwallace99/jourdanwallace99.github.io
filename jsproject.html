        <h1>Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!</h1>
        <h2>Rock paper scissors is a hand game in which each player simultaneously forms one of three 
            shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock", "paper", 
            and "scissors". Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.</h2>
